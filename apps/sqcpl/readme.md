#SQCPL(SiarnaQ's Custom Programming Language) Programming Language Readme:

*1: Requirements:
Python Runtime 3.13


*2: Syntax & Using:

print = prints to console.
char = single character.
else = otherwise (if the specified if condition is not met).
elsif = else-if (if the first if doesn't work, but this one does).
pass = skips, continues to the next code without executing anything.
stp = holds, pauses for the specified duration before running the next code.
crint = creates a variable.
text = text. Max 14,000 characters.
? = end of a code statement.
! = comment line.
!n = not equal.
: = used to specify the command to execute.
math = makes math operations.

*Using:
*Example SQCPL Code:

print "Hello, WORLD!"?
crint c = 80?
crint y = 60?
math m = c + y?
print m?


CONSOLE:

Hello, WORLD!
140



*WARNING:

When an "if" block has condition met, the else and elsif commands that connected on that "if" block, appears at console as "Unknown Command" but it not brokes their function. And, when you try to close the application, it opens one more and then be closed.
